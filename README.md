## Scripts

- `dev`: Starts the dev server. Copies image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp) from `projects/{projectName}/` to `public/assets/projects/{projectName}/` on start, and clears them on stop.
- `build`: Builds for production. Copies the same images to `out/assets/projects/{projectName}/` after build.
