Hi, Im Deniz. Welcome to my personal portfolio project. This project was created to showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. It was also an opportunity for me to learn more about Next.js 14 App router and MDX. Please visit [Donis.dev](https://donis.dev/) to view the project live and/or contact me.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
-   **SEO Friendly:** All content is statically generated at build time using next static export.
-   **Handcrafted:** I've designed all components used in the project including dynamic carousel for my skills/projects showcase components in the landing page.
-   **Contact Form** Thanks to email.js I was able to send email through my website without the need for a backend server.
-   **Easy Content Management** Thanks to MDX support, I can create blog posts and projects as markdown files with exported custom data fields. These MDX files are easily integrated into my app. Works perfect with SSG which was the main goal. No need for a database or any backend.
