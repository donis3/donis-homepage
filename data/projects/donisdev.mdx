## Donis.Dev Project

I wanted a static page with easy to add content to without a database or a backend.
Next.js and static exports with MDX was the solution I came up with since its widely adapted within the industry.
This project allowed me to get a deeper understanding of the App router and SSG (generateStaticParams).

## Technologies

-   **Next.js 14**: Newly updated powerful react framework with App router and server components.
-   **SSG**: No need for a backend server with Next.JS static exports. Perfect for SEO and page load time optimizations.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing a utility-first CSS framework for streamlined styling and enhanced design.
-   **MDX**: Easy file based content management with markdown and jsx support for my blog and project pages.

## Content management

The blog and projects pages will search data/posts and data/projects directories respectively.
Each filename represents their postId or projectId.
during the `generateStaticParams` process at build time, each file in the directory will be read and their metadata extracted using dynamic imports.

here is the load data function from the useProjects.ts hook:

```ts
async function getProjectData(
	filename: string,
	key: "data" | "metadata",
): Promise<ProjectType> {
	//Lazy load the mdx file for the project
	if (!filenames.includes(filename)) throw new Error();
	const file = await import("@/data/projects/" + filename + ".mdx");
	if (file[key]) return file[key];
	else {
		throw new Error();
	}
}
```

Here is an example project data that will be imported from the mdx file:

```ts
export const data = {
	id: "donisdev",
	title: "Donis.dev Personal Portfolio",
	year: 2023,
	subtitle:
		"My personal portfolio developed using Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and MDX for content management.",
	tech: ["Next.Js", "App Router"],
	images: ["donisdev_cover.png"],
	link: "https://www.donis.dev",
	repo: "https://github.com/donis3/donis-homepage",
};
```

This flexible system allows me to add a single mdx file to projects or posts folder and the rest will be taken care of at build time.

## Deployment

After configuring Next.js to use static exports,
`npm run build` command will generate a static html website at /out directory.
When deploying to Github Pages this process takes place in the gh cloud.
Site is generated and served automatically.
