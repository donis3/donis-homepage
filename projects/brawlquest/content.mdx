# BrawlQuest

BrawlQuest is a full-stack Next.js application hosted on a VPS that has been actively updated for around 2 years, keeping pace with the Brawl Stars mobile game updates. Built using Next.js App Router, it provides a seamless experience across devices for tracking your Brawl Stars progress.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Support**: English and Turkish language support with automatic detection using i18next.
- **User Authentication**: Login functionality to remember your user tag for personalized tracking.
- **Player Lookup**: Look up any player by their user tag to view detailed stats.
- **Leaderboards**: View leaderboards and top players per country or globally.
- **Brawler Inventory Tracking**: View owned brawlers, including gadgets, gears, and star powers, with calculations for coins and power-points spent per brawler or account.
- **Progression Tracking**: Monitor progression towards soft-cap and hard-capping each brawler and account.
- **Social Sharing**: Dynamically generates a social-sharable player progress card.
- **Rich Media Assets**: All brawlers include high-quality images, animations (GIFs), and icons for all gadgets, gears, and star powers.

## Internal Brawl Manager Tool

To support the ongoing updates and maintenance of BrawlQuest, I developed a separate internal application dedicated to managing the brawler database and icon collection. This tool streamlines the process of updating the app's data and assets, ensuring that BrawlQuest remains current with the latest Brawl Stars game changes.

## SEO Performance

BrawlQuest has achieved significant organic growth through search engine optimization without any paid ads or promotions. It receives approximately 10,000 impressions and 400 clicks per month from Google search, resulting in around 1,100 active monthly users as tracked by Google Analytics.

This application empowers Brawl Stars players to deeply analyze their gameplay, optimize their strategies, and share their achievements with the community.
