Dartofon is a mobile-first dart score keeping application designed to be easy to use and intuitive for dart players. Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Next.js App Router with static export, it provides a seamless experience across devices.

## Key Features

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices with a responsive interface that works great on phones and tablets.
- **Two Game Modes**:
   - **101x**: Standard dart scoring where players start at 101 and subtract their scores until reaching zero.
   - **Ladder**: A competitive mode where players climb up a ladder by hitting specific targets.
- **Player Management**: Remembers previously added players and enables easy addition, removal, and reordering of players.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: All game data is saved locally using Zustand for state management, ensuring your progress is never lost.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provides English and Turkish language options with cookie-based persistence.
- **Static Export**: Deployed as a static site, making it fast to load and easy to host.

This app makes keeping score during dart games effortless, whether you're playing casually or in a tournament setting.
