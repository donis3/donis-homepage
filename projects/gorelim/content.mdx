## Key Features

- **Anonymous Shortening**: Shorten links without requiring an account, making it quick and easy for one-off uses.
- **Advanced Features with Login**: Logging in unlocks premium capabilities for enhanced link management.

- **Custom Redirect Messages**: Display custom text messages on the redirect page for branded or informative experiences.
- **Instant Redirects**: Create links that redirect immediately without any intermediate pages.
- **Expiry Dates**: Set expiration dates for links to automatically deactivate after a specified time.
- **API Integration**: Perform all operations programmatically using the REST API. Obtain an API key through the developer portal after logging in.

## Admin Features

- **Authentication**: Secure login via better-auth with Google OAuth provider for streamlined access.
- **User Management**: Admins can grant admin roles to other users, ban accounts temporarily (for a week) or permanently.

## Auto Analytics

Analytics are automatically updated through webhooks and cron jobs running on the VPS. This ensures semi-up-to-date application performance insights without manual intervention.

Gorel.im combines simplicity with powerful features, making it an ideal tool for developers, marketers, and everyday users looking to manage their links effectively.
